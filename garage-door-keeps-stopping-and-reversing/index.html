A garage door that keeps reversing when you attempt to close it with the opener might have a simple problem or a major issue that requires a service professional. If there is one, the sensors will keep the door from closing completely, which prevents any damage to the garage door or the car. Obstructions that homeowners often overlook are not just found on the ground, as the tracks can also get lined with items that could halt and reverse the closing of a door. Doing this can save you some amount of cash.
