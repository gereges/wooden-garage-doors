Why Does My Door Keep Reversing When I Try to Close It From youtube.com

What is happening is that you door reaches fully closed before the down travel limit switch is triggered. The garage door does not close all the way in the case of automatic doors, this may be due to issues with your limit switch. The garage door opener has several safety sensors (photo eyes) in place to prevent damage or injury should something obstruct the door as it is closing.
